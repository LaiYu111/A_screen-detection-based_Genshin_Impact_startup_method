# A screen-detection-based way to launch Genshin Impact (White)

## README.md

- [简体中文](./readme/README.zh_CN.md)

- [English](README.md)

## Introduction

Keep the program as simple as possible. Idealy, detect whole screen that is white then launch the Genshin Impact. However, we have to consider lots of things. So replace the entire screen is white idea with **detecting the first pixel is white** method (Maybe I'll updata it later, maybe not XD).  Have fun XD 

## Configuration

## Caution

Note !!  This is a MVP (Minimal Variable Product), this program works, but it's not optimized. 

When the progress from "A" to "Genshin Impact", the "A" progress is still running.

So, before running this program, please make sure your compute has a good performance. Otherwise, I am not sure your computer would crash.
